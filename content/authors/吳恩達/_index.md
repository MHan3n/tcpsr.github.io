Sau-Chin Chen is the associate professor of [Department of Human Development and Psychology, Tzu-Chi University](http://www.hdd.tcu.edu.tw/) since 2017. Between 2016 Feb and 2017 Jan, I was visiting [Department of Psychology, Erasmus University Rotterdam](http://www.eur.nl/fsw/english/psychology/). Durning this period, I am collaborating with [Rolf Zwaan](http://rolfzwaan.blogspot.nl/) on the mental simulation in language comprehension. You will find the articles and blog posts about my research that are going to be updated.

Since 2017, I joined [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/) and contributed the [object orientation effects across languages](https://psyarxiv.com/t2pjv/) as one of the initial collaborative research projects. To practice what I have learned from [The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](https://improvingpsych.org/), I am managing the podcast [open cafe](https://anchor.fm/opensci-cafe) and running the community [Taiwan Collaboration for Psychological Scientific Research](https://sites.google.com/gms.tcu.edu.tw/exppsyunion/). Both projects aim to ground the open and reproducible sciences in Taiwan and Chinese-speaking societies. Till 2021, I am participating in the operations of [Psychological Science Accelerator](https://psysciacc.org/) and [The Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science](https://improvingpsych.org/) as the associative director and executive commitee.
